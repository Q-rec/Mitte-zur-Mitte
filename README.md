#Von der Mitte zur Mitte

###The project „von der Mitte zur Mitte“ was the first part of the course [Eingabe Ausgabe] (https://fhp.incom.org/workspace/6176) by Fabian Morón Zirfas at the FH-Potsdam

_At first, there was the task to create an analog algorithm. After creating the algorithm, ten people had to execute it._

The Algorithm

>Start at a center of a side of your choice
draw a line to another center of a side
you are not allowed to remove the pen from the paper while drawing
pattern and shapes are welcome

#The idea was to connect all the works afterwards, to get one line, drawed by ten different people. This is the result:

!(result)[01]

The next step, was to create an digital algorithm, which should mesmerise the analog one. Because of a lack of more than basic javascript skills, the first task was to connect a line from one center to another, while doing different movements and forms everytime.
I decided to use a line which would always go from center A to center B just with some noise in the line. Some results are shown here:

!(result)[02] !(result)[03] !(result)[04] !(result)[05]

But the real Beauty of the analog algorithm lied in the plurality of the results, which often showed some cool pictures, like the one with the head. It wasn´t obtainable whit this kind of code.

The next big step was to change the code in a way, to create a real difference between the pictures.

The next digital Algorithm

>create a grid
start at a center, and create a line to the middle
always go to a neighbor at this grid and create a line between these two
if you reach one centerpoint, create a line to the edge and stop drawing

The colors has been changed to make the apperence more interesting

!(result)[06] !(result)[07] !(result)[08] !(result)[09]

How can you use it?

An Idea to use this kind of algorithm would be a floor-projection at a art-exibiton which lead your way from one object to another. So every particiant of the exibition could get a different experience, by seeing the artwork in different order.
It could look like this:

!(result)[10]
